# Evaluation Notebook

This directory contains a Jupyter Notebook (`evaluation_notebook.ipynb`) used to evaluate the results of the study. The notebook includes code to analyse the questionnaire responses and create plots for the presentation. Helper variables have been extracted to the `constants.py` file for easier configuration.
## Getting Started

If you set up the repository wide Python environment as described in the main `README.md`, you can run the notebook directly. If you haven't set up the environment yet, follow the steps outlined in the [main README](../README.md) first.

Otherwise, the notebook is standalone and should be self-explanatory.

## Folder Structure

The folder contains two additional folders of note besides the notebook itself:

- `data/` â€” This folder is used to store the results data from the study.
- `out/` - This folder contains any output files generated by the notebook, such as plots and analysis results in CSV format.
