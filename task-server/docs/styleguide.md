# Styleguide: Spacing System

## Spacing Rules

- All spacing (margins and paddings) should use multiples of 8px: **8, 16, 24, 32**.
- Use `16px` for most component padding and vertical spacing between major elements.
- Use `24px` or `32px` for larger separations, such as between main sections or for outer margins (this does not apply to the outermost elements of pages, since they may set the page background colour)
- Use `8px` for small gaps, such as between form fields, buttons, or inline elements.
- Avoid arbitrary spacing values; stick to the defined scale for consistency.
- Center main content with `margin: '0 auto'` and set a consistent `maxWidth` (e.g., 480px) for main pages.
- All new components and layouts should follow this spacing system for both margin and padding.
