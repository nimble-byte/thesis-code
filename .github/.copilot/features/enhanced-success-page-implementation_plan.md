# Implementation Plan: Enhanced Success Page with Solution Report

## Feature Overview

Display a detailed visual report on the success page after a user submits their solution, including a table of solved tasks and a solution ID with a copy-to-clipboard feature.

## Current State Analysis

- The current success page only shows a static success message.
- No information about the solved tasks or solution details is displayed.
- Users cannot easily access or copy their solution ID.

## Goals

- Show a table listing each solved task with PID, question, user's answer, correct answer, and time taken.
- Display the solution ID prominently.
- Provide a button to copy the solution ID to the clipboard.
- Improve user feedback and transparency after submission.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Data Integration & UI Components

#### 1.1 Solution Data Retrieval (Dual Approach)

- The page should support two ways to obtain the solution data:
  - **Preferred:** Accept a `TaskSetSolution` object passed directly (e.g., via navigation state, context, or query params) from the task set page after completion.
  - **Fallback:** If no solution object is provided, fetch the solution from the backend using a solution ID (e.g., from the URL or query params).
- This ensures fast UX after completion and also allows direct access/bookmarking for a specific solution report.

#### 1.2 Create Task Report Table

- **Purpose**: Display a table with columns: PID, Question, User's Answer, Correct Answer, Time Taken.
- **Features**:
  - Responsive and accessible table layout.
  - Proper formatting for time taken.

#### 1.3 Display Solution ID & Copy Button

- **Purpose**: Show the solution ID below the table.
- **Features**:
  - Prominent display of the solution ID.
  - Button to copy the ID to clipboard with user feedback (e.g., "Copied!").

### Phase 2: Styling & UX Enhancements

#### 2.1 Style the Report Table

- Consistent with app theme.
- Highlight correct/incorrect answers if desired.

#### 2.2 Enhance Copy-to-Clipboard UX

- Add tooltip or temporary message on successful copy.

### Implementation Priority

| Priority | Feature                        | Category |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | -------- |
| 1        | Fetch solution data            | high     |
| 2        | Task report table              | high     |
| 3        | Solution ID & copy button      | medium   |
| 4        | Styling & UX enhancements      | low      |

## Future Enhancements

- Allow users to download the report as PDF or CSV.
- Add visual charts (e.g., time per task, accuracy).
- Show comparison to previous attempts or average stats.
- Add links to review each task in detail.

## Notes

- Ensure data privacy and security when displaying solution details.
- Handle cases where solution data is missing or incomplete.
- Consider accessibility for all new UI elements.
